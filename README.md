# README Generator

## Description
This project creates a professional level README file for any user that runs the program. The motivation behind this project was to make creating README documents a little bit less tedious. In the process of creating it I learned how to use switch case, template literals, and the inquirer node package.

## Installation
User must have the inquirer package installed. In order to do so, navigate to the command line of the directory and enter "npm install inquirer."

## Usage
In order to use this program, the user must first complete the installation guide above. Once this is done, re-navigate to the command line and enter "npm start." This will initiate the program and prompt the user with questions regarding the creation of a README file. After completing the questions, the user will be able to use a new file that has been created detailing all of the information they just gave in the form of a README file.
